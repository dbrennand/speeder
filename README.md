# Speedtest-grafana

Use [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/) and the [librespeed/speedtest-cli](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-cli) to monitor your internet speed! üöÄ

## Prerequisites

1. Docker

2. docker-compose

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
>
> Make sure you run the commands below from the project directory.

1. Build the speedtest-grafana container image using the command: `docker-compose build`

2. Set the `SPEEDTEST_SERVER_ID` environment variable located in the [.env](.env) file to the server ID to perform speedtests against.

    > [!NOTE]

## Disclaimer

I did **NOT** create the LibreSpeed project or CLI. The great folks over at [LibreSpeed](https://github.com/librespeed) did.
